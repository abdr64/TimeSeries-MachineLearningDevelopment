# Time Series - Submission 02
In submission section, the student must build a machine learning model for text classification and meet the submission criteria.

The criteria's are:

 - Any time series dataset with a minimum of **1000 samples**
 - Must use **LSTM** in the model
 - A model must be built in **Sequential**
 - Validation set must be **20%** of the dataset
 - Must use **Learning Rate** in the optimizer
 - Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is below **10%** of the data scale

Reviewers will give ratings by scaling from 1 - 5 based on the code when the task has met the criteria.

The details of the ratings are: 

 1. Indicated of plagiarism
 2. The code needs to be fixed
 3. Only to follow the modules provided in the course
 4. Using a dataset with **2000 samples**
 5. Using a dataset with **10000 samples**

 The codes in this repository are results of my Time Series works. The accepted code is called **Submission_02_Time_Series_Perbaikan_02.ipynb**
